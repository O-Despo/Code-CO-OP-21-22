# Code-CO-OP-21-22
The Repo for the Code CO-OP club for the 21-22 year

This repo will contain our notes and class work. File will be either [python](https://www.python.org/), [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), or [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you are unfamiliar with these formats I recommend using checking out the links.

## Schedule 

- Meeting every Tuesday and Thursday at advisory in the Makers Space (Room 309). 
- We have club meetings when ever the high school has Orange club days also in 309
- Office hours are from 5:00pm - 5:30pm on Thursday on zoom

## Organization

TBD - I am still experimenting with how to organize notes should finish soon.

## Resources

Its fully understandable if can't make it to meetings or just want to look further down different rabbit holes. If either of these is the case I recommend these resources.

#### Python resources

- [Python Land](https://python.land/introduction-to-python) ‚≠ê Recommend for getting started 
- [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [Python Practice Book](https://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html)
- [PythonTutorial.net](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-syntax/)
- [Google Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction)
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)(

My recommendation is to try these out and see which fits you style. It should be noted that Free Code Camp is more slow but goes over a lot more than just python. 

#### Code Sharing 

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### IDE (Integrated Development Environment

This is a application where you edit and run code.

- [repl.it](https://replit.com/~) ‚≠êüåê Recommend (Web-based)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ‚≠êüíæ Recommended (Local)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- Vim 

#### Other Topics of Interest

If you are bored and want to go down a rabbit hole

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)
- [Three Js](https://threejs.org/)

## If you just want to learn to code and have no clue what this is

1. Go to the Python Land link
2. Follow the instructions given
3. If you have questions reach out

This is not a easy task but you will make it through.
