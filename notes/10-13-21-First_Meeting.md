## Git/Github

Git is a method of "version control" that focuses on looking at data as a stream of changes. It was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

**In Short**: it is a way to keep track of changes to files.

Github is a platform that was developed to store code from git repositories. 

## Open source

Open source software runs on code that is publicly accessible. This also means that it is often collaboratively developed. Anyone can see, change, or branch the code that is there.

## Linux

Linux is a open source kernel and with the addition of other software suites can be used as a Operating System. It was developed by Linus Torvalds and is now used widely on servers.
